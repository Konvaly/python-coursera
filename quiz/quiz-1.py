# Example-1
# This function will accept an integer variable "end" and count by 10
# from 0 to the "end" value.

    # Initializeq the "count" variable as a string.
    count = ""

    # The range function parameters instruct Python to start the count  
    # at 0 and stop at the variable given as the upper end of the range. 
    # Since the value of the high end of a range is excluded by default,  
    # you can make Python include the "end" value by adding +1 to it. 
    # The third parameter tells Python to increment the count by 10.
    for number in range(0,end+1,10):

        # Although the variable "count" will hold a count of integers,  
        # this example will be converted to a string using "str(number)" 
        # in order to display the incremental count from 0 to the "end" 
        # value on the same line with a space " " separating each 
        # number.  
        count += str(number) + " "

    # the string "count"  
    return count.strip()

# Call the function with 1 integer parameter.
print(count_by_10(100))

# Should print 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100

# Example-2
# This function uses a set of nested for loops with the range() function 
# to create a matrix of numbers. The upper range value in the range() 
# function should be included in the matrix. The matrix should consist 
# of a set of numbers that fill both rows and columns.
def matrix(initial_number, end_of_first_row):


    # It is an optional code style to assign the long variable names in the
    # function parameters to shorter variable names. 
    n1 = initial_number 
    n2 = end_of_first_row+1  # include the upper range value with +1

    # The first for loop will create the columns.
    for column in range(n1, n2):

        # The nested for loop will create the rows.
        for row in range(n1, n2):

            # To make the matrix of numbers easier to read, include a space
            # between each number in the rows until the loop reaches the 
            # end of the row. You can override the default behavior of the 
            # print() function (which inserts a new line character after 
            # the print command runs) by using the "end=" "" parameter 
            # inside the print() function.  
              print(column*row, end=" ")

        # The row ends when the upper range value is encountered within the 
        # nested for loop. The outer (column) for loop should insert a new line
        # to create the next row. Use the print() function new line default 
        # behavior with an empty print() function:
        print()


# Call the function with 2 integer parameters. 
matrix(1, 4)
# Should print:
# 1 2 3 4 
# 2 4 6 8 
# 3 6 9 12 
# 4 8 12 16 

#
#Example-3
# For this example, the outer for loop uses an end of range index of 
# 10. The value of index 10 will be 10-1, or 9.  
for outer_loop in range(10):

    # Using the "outer_loop" variable as the end of range for the  
    # inner loop, means the end of range index will be 9. The value 
    # of index 9 will be 9-1, or 8.
    for inner_loop in range(outer_loop):

        # The printed result is the value of "inner_loop". Since  
        # there aren’t any calculations in this loop, there is a 
        # simple shortcut for solving what the final value printed 
        # by the "inner_loop" will be. The solution is to simply use 
        # the value of the "inner_loop" index, which is 8.
        print(inner_loop)
        

#
#Example-4
# This function should count down by -2 from 11 to 1, so that it only
# prints odd numbers. 

# This range(11, -2) tells the for loop to start at 11 and end at index
# position -2 (which corresponds to the numeric value of -1). Since the
# third incremental or decremental value is missing, the loop will 
# increment by the default of +1 instead of the intended -2 decrement.
# Starting at index position 11 and incrementing by +1 will end the loop 
# automatically, because the index is not counting down towards -2 as 
# the end of the range. 

# To fix this problem, the range() needs three parameters:
# First parameter should be the starting index position of 11.
# Second parameter should be the ending index position of 0 (value 1).
# Third parameter should be decrementing by -2.
# So, the range should be configured as range(11, 0, -2).

# Fix this loop with the corrected range parameters and click Run.
for n in range(11,1, -2):
    if n % 2 != 0:
        print(n, end=" ")

# Should print: 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 once the problem is fixed.

#
#Example-5
# For this example, the while loop will count down by threes starting 
# from 18 and ending at 0.
starting_number = 18

# The while loop will continue to loop until it reaches 0.
while starting_number >= 0:

    # To make the sequence of numbers easier to read, include a space
    # between each number in the sequence. You can override the default 
    # behavior of the print() function by using the "end=" parameter with
    # the print() function. The syntax for adding a space is: end=" " 
    print(starting_number, end=" ")
    
    # Decrement the "starting_number" variable by -3.
    starting_number -= 3

# Should print 18 15 12 9 6 3 0 

#
#Example-6
# This function accepts a CEO's salary as a variable. 
# It counts the number of digits in the salary and 
# returns the sentence like:
# "The CEO has a 6-figure salary."
def X_figure(salary):
    
    # Initializes the counter as an integer.
    tally = 0

    # The if-statement checks if the variable "salary" 
    # is equal to 0.
    if salary == 0:
        # If true, then it increments the counter to 
        # show there is 1 digit in 0.
        tally += 1

    # The while loop starts to run while the "salary"
    # is greater than or equal to 1 (the loop will 
    # not run if the "salary" is 0).
    while salary >= 1:

        # The body of the while loop counts the digits 
        # in "salary" by counting the number of times  
        # "salary" can be divided by 10 until "salary" 
        # is no longer >= 1.
        salary = salary/10

        # Add 1 to the counter to tally the number of 
        # times the loop runs.
        tally += 1

    # Return the results of the "tally" of the number
    # of digits in "salary".

# Call the X_figure function with 1 parameter, converted to a string,
