# Example-3
# Example of nested for loops:
# This code demonstrates the outer and inner loop iterations of a pair 
# of nested for loops. Click "Run" to see the results. The outer loop
# will run twice for the range pointer positions [0, 1] in range(2).
# The inner loop will run 4 times for the range pointer positions 
# [0, 1, 2, 3] in range(3+1) or range(4) each time the outer loop runs.
# So, the inner loop will execute 8 times in total.

for x in range(2):
  print("This is the outer loop iteration number " + str(x))
  for y in range(3+1):
    print("Inner loop iteration number " + str(y))
print("Exit inner loop")
