# Variables Annotated by Type

import typing
# Define a variable of type str
z: str = "Hello, world!"
# Define a variable of type int
x: int = 10
# Define a variable of type float
y: float = 1.23
# Define a variable of type list
list_of_numbers: typing.List[int] = [1, 2, 3]
# Define a variable of type tuple
tuple_of_numbers: typing.Tuple[int, int, int] = (1, 2, 3)
# Define a variable of type dict
dictionary: typing.Dict[str, int] = {"key1": 1, "key2": 2}
# Define a variable of type set
set_of_numbers: typing.Set[int] = {1, 2, 3}

# The following lines assign the variable to the left of the = 
# assignment operator with the values and arithmetic expressions 
# on the right side of the = assignment operator.
hotel_room = 100
tax = hotel_room * 0.08
total = hotel_room + tax
room_guests = 4
share_per_person = total/room_guests


# This line outputs the result of the final calculation stored
# in the variable "share_per_person"
print("Each person needs to pay: " + str(share_per_person)) # change a data type



#Output multiple string variables on a single line to form a sentence

#Use the plus (+) connector or a comma to connect strings in a print() function

#Create spaces between variables in  a print() function

# The following 5 lines assign strings to a list of variables.
salutation = "Dr."
first_name = "Prisha"
middle_name = "Jai"
last_name = "Agarwal"
suffix = "Ph.D."
 
print(salutation + " " + first_name + " " + middle_name + " " + last_name + ", " + suffix) 
# The comma as a string ", " adds the conventional use of a comma plus a 
# space to separate the last name from the suffix.
 
# Alternatively, you could use commas in place of the + connector:
print(salutation, first_name, middle_name, last_name,",", suffix)
# However, you will find that this produces a space before a comma within a string.


# 2 TASK

# 1) Complete the code to return the result of the conversion
def convert_distance(km):
	m = km * 1000  # exactly 1000 meters in 1 kilometer
	return m


# Do not indent any of the following lines of code as they are
# meant to be located outside of the function above


my_trip_kilometers = 55


# 2) Convert my_trip_kilometers to meters by calling the function above
my_trip_meters = convert_distance(my_trip_kilometers)


# 3) Fill in the blank to print the result of converting my_trip_kilometers
print("The distance in meters is " + str(my_trip_meters))
